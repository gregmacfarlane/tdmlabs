#tdmlabs

This repository contains homework and labs for CEE 6622: Travel Demand Analysis
at the Georgia Institute of Technology, which I taught in 2012 and 2014.
The labs are general, and are designed for graduate students who are currently
or who have already taken a course in urban transportation planning.

Currently the labs are built in a mix of Rmarkdown and Sweave; it would be more
ideal to update them all to RMarkdown, creating a jekyll site instead of a PDF
manual.  Contributions are welcome.

## Course objectives
Students who complete this course will know the capabilities, benefits, and
weaknesses of an urban travel demand modeling system. Topics include:

  - How to edit and run travel model scenarios
  - Extracting and presenting data from a travel model
  - Details of the four-step travel demand modeling process
  - Integration of land use and other corollary models
  - Concepts of activity-based models
  - Data sources used to build travel models

To illustrate these topics, students will use the Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City)
travel demand model to execute alternatives analyses and examine the sensitivity
of the model to changes in networks and underlying behavioral models.

## Preparation
Students who take this course will be expected to already have knowledge of:

  - Elementary programming techniques (functions, for-loops, etc.) in any language (e.g., C, R, VBA)
  - Elementary GIS concepts (shapefiles, projections, etc.)
  - Intermediate mathematics (statistics, some linear algebra and calculus)
  - Urban transportation systems and planning processes (CEE 6602 prerequisite)

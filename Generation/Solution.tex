\maketitle






This lab requires the students to complete two general tasks. In the first, the
students estimate a regression model from NHTS household-level data considering
multiple covariates. In the second, they estimate a cross-classification model
from these same data.


\section*{Generation Models}




The data come from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, and contain the 
number of trips made for different types by 106,564 households. 
Some minor formatting was done to code unknown values as \texttt{NA} or to adjust
income from a categorical variable to a continuous value. The students may 
need to do other variable formatting depending on which variables they use.




The models are presented in Table \ref{tab:models}. The first model estimates 
the number of work-based trips considering only the number of workers in the 
household. This model predicts that each worker in a household will increase 
the number of work trips by on average 0.8238 trips
per day. This is somewhat lower than I would initially expect, given that workers
typically stereotypically make two HBW trips in a day (home and back). On the
other hand, this variable alone only explains 
33.21\% of the variance in work trips.
Perhaps there are some other explanations that the other models can help 
identify.

{\em At this point the students should discuss the findings of their other 
models.}

One item of note is that a model with only workers and income (Model 4) has a 
positive coefficient estimate on income, indicating that as the household
income increases, this household will make {\em more} trips, all else equal. But
when other hosuehold variables are considered, an increase in income will 
result in {\em fewer} trips. This could indicate that there is some correlation 
between income and the other variables (which would be expected), and also that 
the income variable may not be coded properly. At any rate, the effect of income
on home-based work trips is very small, with a \$100,000 increase in income 
resulting in a decrease of only 0.1 trips in Model 5.

\subsection*{Cross-classification Models}
The students should also estimate cross-classification models of trips with 
categories for the household size (number of adults) and vehicle availability.
The code for this is straightforward, as it is just a conditional mean. The 
students first need to cap the categories.




In class we used the \texttt{aggregate} function. I wonder if there is a way in 
the new \texttt{dplyr} package, but I haven't looked yet. At any rate, the 
cross-classification results are given in Table \ref{tab:ccresults}. What is most 
obvious about these results is that for households with many adults and no 
vehicles, the numbers become very strange or unbelievable. This is likely due
to the fact that these households are rare and underrepresented in the NHTS. 
Perhaps a different way of finding these rates would be more appropriate.

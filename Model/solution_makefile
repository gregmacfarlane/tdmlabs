# Enter the name of the final .pdf document here:
MASTER = Solution.pdf
# Your principal .rnw or .tex file should have
# the same stem. If your principal file is
# foo.rnw, set MASTER = foo.pdf

# This file is designed for UNIX- type
# operating systems and successfully compiles
# on Mac OS X and Red Hat Linux. Compiling on
# Windows will require different LaTeX output
# suppressors (>/dev/null will not be recognized)
